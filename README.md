"# crud-project" 
couldnt finish because i had tight schedule the past week
too many errors in my work but i will continue debugging and also try to finish the project for my personal learning interest and incase i get a chance in re-submitting.
if i'm done with work, can i tag a mentor to just look at it and see how well i did? not for grading purpose but for learning purpose.
